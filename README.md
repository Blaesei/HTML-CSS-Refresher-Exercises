# 3. Styled Product Card
Goal: Combine HTML structure with CSS styling and box model.

Instructions:
Build a product card component: a product image, product name as a heading, short description paragraph, and a “Buy Now” button (just a styled link or button, no JavaScript).
Add a border, border-radius, and box-shadow to make the card stand out.
Set a max-width (e.g., 300 px) and center it on the page.
Use :hover on the button to change background color.
Learning Focus: Box model, borders, shadows, responsive sizing, and button styling.
